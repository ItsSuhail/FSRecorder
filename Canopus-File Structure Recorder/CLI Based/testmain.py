# My Idea: 
+ We input the required directory to be recorded
+ Each element of the directry will be recorded
+ we'll save the recorded file and serialize it with pickle
+ we can see the differences between 2 recordings i.e. we can see the changes which occured


- Understand how the file system in python works
- Record every file structure in a list, then pickle the list
- When loaded any recorded structure, unpickle the data into a list
