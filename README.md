# FSRecorder

## Idea:
+ The idea of the project is to build an interface which would record the state of your file directory with a press of a button and you can later compare whatever changes occured in the structure after the last recorded structure of the directory.

## Motivation:
+ A friend of mine accidentally erased my pendrive and was quick enough to cancel it. This made me feel insecure about my data and further motivated!


## Goals of the project
- [ ] I'll first work upon the CLI based software, and further improve that and add more functionality.
- [ ] Make the GUI based version of the software with more or same functionality
